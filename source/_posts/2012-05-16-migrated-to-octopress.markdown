It's been way too long no blogging, but now I'm starting this blog again.
I moved away from my [custom blogging platform](https://github.com/mikkolehtinen/mikkolehtinen.com) and I'm using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), hosting
pages in GitHub.

Setup and migration was a snap and only issue was converting old posts written in Textile formatting
to markdown. [This demo](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/try) of Pandoc
did help.
