I just received my new [Kindle3][] from Amazon. So far it seems like a
great device for the price (150 EUR shipped to Finland, including all
expenses). The screen is great, battery lasts long and size and weight
are good for e-reader. The UI is still clumsy and feels very outdated,
but with a little tweaking, it does the job. First things I did was:

### Basics

When reading PDFs use **Aa** key to change zoom level, contrast and
screen orientation. I’m reading most of PDF files horizontally, which
gives you nice zoom for smaller font sizes. Most often I prefer to
convert PDF to mobi using Calibre (see below)

### Calibre for e-book syncing

[Calibre][] for managing and syncing your e-books. It seems to be buggy
in the newest release (calibre-0.7.20), but old releases can be found
from [SourceForge][].\
To convert a pdf to a mobibook, run:\
`/Applications/calibre.app/Contents/Resources/loaders/ebook-convert input-filename.pdf output-filename.mobi`

### Ephemera

[Ephemera][] gives you two-way [Instapaper.com][] sync for your ebook
reader without Whispernet traffic fees. However, with Kindle3 it’s
probably easiest to either download new articles through Instapaper
website or even easier to order updates by e-mail.

### Start hacking

Read [Kindle Boards][] and [MobileRead Forums][] to read about latest
development on your device. There’s [Jailbreak][] and [other hacks][]
available, but yet without any useful functionality.
